# fzf & git for-each-ref Â» check 'dis out!

> give me branches

```shell
$ git for-each-ref --format '%(refname:lstrip=2)' refs/heads
JIRA-1337/implement-something-nice
main
```

but remote branches are missing. so we need to get them too

```
$ git fetch --all
From github.com:verfriemelt-dot-org/slides
* [new branch]      JIRA-31337/something-even-nicer -> origin/JIRA-31337/something-even-nicer
$ git for-each-ref --format '%(refname:lstrip=2)' refs/remotes/origin/
origin/JIRA-31337/something-even-nicer
origin/main
```

**does not work**
```
$ git checkout origin/JIRA-31337/something-even-nicer
Note: switching to 'origin/JIRA-31337/something-even-nicer'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
